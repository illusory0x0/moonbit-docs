# MoonBit Native FFI Examples

This section demonstrates MoonBit's Native FFI (Foreign Function Interface) capabilities through practical examples, focusing on `FuncRef` type usage and C language interoperability.

## Overview

These examples showcase how to use MoonBit's `FuncRef` type for safe and efficient interoperability with C code. Each example demonstrates different patterns for passing MoonBit functions to C libraries.

## Examples

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
